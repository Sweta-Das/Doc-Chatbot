      "[{'topic': 'FOREWORD', 'content': 'FOREWORD\\nThe pandemic of COVID-19 had detrimental impact on Nepal’s school education. A nation-wide \\nlockdown of public movement and services was initiated by the Government upon the confirmation of \\nthe first cases of COVID-19 in Nepal in March 2020. In line with this, the Ministry of Education, Science \\nand Technology (MOEST) was forced to shut-down schools. Schools remained closed for almost eight \\nmonths until the end of October 2020. Due to surge in COVID-19 cases as a result of the emerge of the \\nDelta variant, schools were re-closed in April 2021, only to re-open gradually in September that year. \\nAnother surge in cases a result of the Omicron variant caused schools to close yet again for a month \\nat the beginning of 2022. To reduce the effect of the disruptions of services, the MoEST approved the \\nnational School reopening Framework in November 2020, providing guidance for local governments \\nand schools on the safe reopening of their schools However, the diverse context and available resources \\nmeant that the requirements were not equally feasible for all 753 local governments and that schools \\nin some areas remained closed longer than in others. Furthermore, there were stark differences in the \\nextent to which children had access to alternative education programs and resources to continue their \\nlearning during school closures, causing learning loss to be distributed unevenly across Nepal’s student \\npopulation.\\nAs schools have returned to normal service, it is clear that schools throughout Nepal require additional \\nsupport to meet the diverse range of needs that their children present. As a result, the Ministry of \\nEducation, Science and Technology (MoEST) has developed the Recovery and Accelerated Learning \\n(ReAL) Plan in order to provide the framework and mechanisms for schools to receive the support they \\nneed. In addition, it is hoped that the good practices that result from recovering the lost learning will \\nbe integrated into the regular teaching and learning practices in schools so that children experiencing \\nother shocks to their education, or those who need remedial support, will benefit in the future.\\nThe MoEST will implement the ReAL Plan as part of the School Education Sector Plan (SESP). The focus \\nof both plans is the support and capacity building of teachers, school leadership and Local Levels to \\nimplement effective education that identifies and responds to students’ needs. As such, the focus of \\nthe ReAL Plan is at the local and community level and on the foundation literacy and numeracy skills \\nthat are essential to students’ studies.\\nWhist the months of lost schooling can never be replaced, this plan will help ensure that lost schooling \\ndoes not become long term lost learning. By focusing on foundational skills, we believe that children \\nwill be able to address the challenges they have faced while their schools were shut, and they will not \\nsuffer the lifelong barriers of lost education. The MoEST would like to thank all the contributors and \\nstakeholders who have participated in the development and review of the ReAL Plan. In particular, the \\nSESP Joint Financing Partners: the, the Asian Development Bank, the European Union, the Embassy of \\nFinland, the Royal Norwegian Embassy, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the United States \\nAgency for International Development (USAID) and the World Bank have given time and resources to \\nsupport the plan. In addition, the wider education development community, including the Association \\nof INGOs, other civil society organizations and other active development agencies have given their \\nsupport in the development of the plan. Moving forward, the MoEST is grateful for the cooperation \\nand collaboration of all stakeholders as we collectively support the local levels and schools who will be \\ncontextualizing and implementing the ReAL Plan according to their specific needs.\\nMinistry of Education, Science and Technology\\nSinghadurbar, Kathmandu\\nDecember, 2022\\n1\\nRecovery and Accelerated Learning (ReAL) Plan (2023-2028) '}, {'topic': 'ABBREVIATIONS', 'content': 'ABBREVIATIONS\\nAAL  Above Average Learner\\nADB  Asian Development Bank\\nAL  Advance Learner\\nASER   Annual Status of Education Report\\nBL  Basic Learner\\nBBL  Below Basic Learner\\nCAS   Continuous Assessment System\\nCB-EGRA Classroom Based Early Grade Reading Assessment\\nCEHRD  Center for Education and Human Resource Development \\nCDC  Curriculum Development Center \\nCLAs  Central Level Agencies\\nDEO  District Education Office\\nDOE  Department of Education\\nDP  Development Partner\\nECD  Early Childhood Education\\nECED  Early Childhood Education and Development\\nEDCU  Education Development Coordination Center\\nEGR  Early Grades Reading\\nEGRA  Early Grades Reading Assessment\\nEGMA  Early Grade Math Assessment\\nERO  Education Review Office\\nETC  Education Training Center\\nFLN  Foundational Literacy and Numeracy\\nGON  Government of Nepal \\nGPA  Grade point Average\\nICT  Information, Communication, Technology\\nI/NGO  International/Non-Government Organization\\nLEG  Local Education Group\\nLG  Local Government\\nMOE  Ministry of Education\\nMOEST  Ministry of Education Science and Technology\\nMoU  Memorandum of Understanding\\nNARN  National Assessment of Reading and Numeracy \\nNASA  National Assessment of Student Achievement\\nNEB  National Examination Board\\nPL  Proficient Learner\\nPETC  Provincial Education Training Center\\nPMEC  Priority Minimum Enabling Condition\\nPPC  Pre Primary Class\\nRC  Resource Center\\n2\\nRecovery and Accelerated Learning (ReAL) Plan (2023-2028) | ReAL  Recovery and Accelerated Learning\\nRP  Resource Person \\nSMC  School Management Committee\\nSS  School Supervisor\\nSSDP  School Sector Development Plan\\nSSRP  School Sector Reform Program\\nTA  Technical Assistance\\nTaRL  Teaching at Right Level\\nTLM  Teaching and Learning Materials\\nUSAID  United States Agency for International Development\\n3\\nRecovery and Accelerated Learning (ReAL) Plan (2023-2028) | '}, {'topic': 'Recovery and Accelerated Learning (ReAL)', 'content': 'Government of Nepal\\nMinistry of Education, Science and Technology \\nRecovery and Accelerated Learning (ReAL) \\nin Schools in Nepal\\nNepal’s Context\\nThe pandemic of COVID-19 had detrimental impact on Nepal’s school education. In \\nparticular, because the country was just recovering from devastating impact of the \\nearthquake of 25th April 2015 that had left many schools and classrooms in dilapidated \\ncondition. When the cases of COVID-19 were detected in Nepal, MOEST was forced to \\nshut-down schools until further notice on 19 March 2020. Soon after, the Government \\nof Nepal had to impose a full-lockdown on 24th March 2020. While the lockdown was \\ngradually eased, schools remained closed for multiple time during past two academic \\nyears. Schools first closed in March 2020 and remained closed for almost 8 months \\nuntil the end of October 2020. Schools had to close again in April 2021, due to surge \\nin cases as a result of Delta variant. Schools reopened in September 2021, but had to \\nshut-down again for approximately one month in January 2022 due to surge in cases as \\na result of omicron variant. In early November 2020, MOEST issued school operations \\nguidelines allowing local governments to reopen schools by following the guidelines. \\nHowever, meeting those requirements mentioned in the guidelines were not equally \\nfavorable for many local governments. As a result, schools were kept closed for almost \\na year in many parts of the country after the first shut down of schools.\\nBetween then and now, various snapshot surveys, piloting and testing have been \\nconducted by the government, bi-lateral and multilateral agencies and I/NGOs to trace \\nthe impact of COVID on education, especially about learning loss. These studies and \\nreports provide enriching information in assessing the loss and in setting the context \\nfor Nepal.\\nWhile loss of an academic year itself is irrecoverable, loss of learning can be recovered \\nby adopting measures that are appropriate and specific to the country context. For \\nthis, measures applied need to be contextual and should be part of/ aligned with the \\neducation sector’s institutional set up.      \\nImproving quality of education  in community schools in Nepal has been one of the \\nkey objectives of the various sector plans that have been implemented over the last \\ntwo decades. Unfortunately, this has not yet led to the improvements envisioned, with \\n5\\nRecovery and Accelerated Learning (ReAL) Plan (2023-2028) | a report published in 2019 by the MoEST’s Education Review Office (ERO) indicating \\nthat only 28 percent and 45 percent of students demonstrated adequate proficiency \\nin Mathematics and Nepali language, in grade 5 and 3 respectively1. Another study2, \\nconducted by ERO in 2018 shows only 8.41% of students in Grade 3 could meet \\nthe grade-level reading proficiency as defined by MoEST3. These numbers confirm \\nboth that prior to the COVID-19 related disruptions, there was significant learning \\nloss occurring in the system and that there is a need to focus interventions towards \\nensuring foundational learning in the early grades. Failing to acquire proficiency in \\nbasic reading and numeracy skills during these years will prevent these children to \\nprogress in their later learning and life opportunities, thereby affecting sustainable \\ndevelopment in the long run4.  \\nIf we examine closely, learning loss caused by frequent and sometimes long-term \\nclosure of schools, has occurred throughout past years before the pandemic as a \\nrecurrent phenomenon in Nepal’s schools. The loss has been caused by frequent \\nschool closure due to climate, geography, and human induced causes such as floods, \\ndraught, fire, earthquake, and strike actions etc. Therefore, although unprecedented \\nin its duration and impact, the school closures caused by the COVID-19 pandemic \\nwere not unique in terms of disruptions in the Nepal education system contributed to \\nlearning loss.  \\nIt is however important to take note of the fact that this learning loss is different \\nacross regions and different groups of learners, based on the pre-COVID-19 existing \\nquality of education, pre-vulnerability of the learners in terms of drivers of disparity \\nthat they face based on their location, ability, caste/ethnicity, gender, social economic \\nstatus, mother tongue, etc. Therefore, when attempting to address learning loss, an \\nequity-perspective must be included in terms of analyzing where this loss has been \\ndisproportional and additional resources and measures must be mobilized/applied \\nto recover. Some major considerations that are informing the analysis of the existing \\npre- and post-COVID-19 learning assessment- and educational administrative data to \\nunderstand these drivers of disparity in terms of learning loss have been stated below.\\n1. Insufficiency of quality infrastructure , both physical and academic, has long \\nbeen a concern in community schools in Nepal. The Government of Nepal and \\nits development partners felt the need to improving the quality of school’s \\nlearning environment. As such, the School Sector Reform Plan (SSRP) 2009-\\n2015, introduced specific policy on meeting the prioritized minimum enabling \\nconditions (PMEC) in all community schools of Nepal. Poor learning environment \\nin schools have been categorically indicated as being one of the major enabling \\nfactors for students to drop out early.\\n1  GON. 2019.

Learning Poverty. World Bank.\\n6\\nRecovery and Accelerated Learning (ReAL) Plan (2023-2028) | 2. Work related migration has contributed to decreasing youth’s career \\nexpectations. Declining career expectation is associated with political instability \\nand lack of opportunity for income and career growth within country. Because \\nof low career expectations, the demand for high quality education is also low. \\nA passing grade is what many youths just look for as in many cases they have \\nalready set their minds to migrate for job.  While a large share of the national \\neconomy depends on remittance sent home by these migrating work force, \\nmajority of them land in an unskilled and low wage job due to lack of proper \\ntraining and education.  \\n3. Highest impact of school closure is on early graders5 who did not have access \\nto remote learning. \\n4. Along with the learning loss, increase in number of school dropouts6 is \\ninevitable if nothing is done to address the fact that student learning levels will \\nhave further deviated within their respective age groups due to the unequal \\nimpact of the disruptions. Flash Report-II (2021-22) indicates 13.6% children in \\nECED/PPEs; 14.5% students in lower basic (Grades 1-5); and 10.5% students in \\nupper basic (grades 6-8) education were not regularly attending throughout the \\nschool year, which can be taken as an indication that these children are on the \\nverge/in the process of dropping out.  \\n5. Gender equity and social inclusion7 is likely to widen in the days to come. As the \\nequity index shows, caste/ethnicity, followed by gender were the two dominant \\ndrivers of disparity in the local governments with the highest disparities in \\nlearning outcomes, which have been computed under the consolidated equity \\nstrategy since 2018 onwards. \\n6. Nepal is a country that is highly prone to different forms of natural and human \\ninduced disaster  and therefore school closure has time and again remained as \\na common phenomenon.\\n7. Increased poverty and food shortage is forecasted8 for countries like Nepal \\nwhich will have profound effect on education and learning. \\n5  The World Bank. 2022.

Accelerating Learning Recovery: A Guidance Note for Addressing Learning Losses in the Context of \\nCOVID-19 and Building Back Better.\\n8  Ibid.\\n7\\nRecovery and Accelerated Learning (ReAL) Plan (2023-2028) | Challenges\\n1. Impact of COVID-19 on school education is gradually coming into the sight with \\nits impact not only in lower grades but also in higher grades. Recently published \\nSecondary Education Examinations (SEE) of year 2078 BS which was held \\nbetween April 22 and May 03, 2022, has shown deteriorating quality of exam \\nscores. Percent of students with higher GPA scores have dropped significantly \\ncompared to previous years. \\n2. The learning loss is recoverable, but making up for loss of time will be a challenge \\nin terms of covering curriculum that was planned during the two years of school \\nclosures. It is necessary that students, while in higher grades, must gain the basic \\ncompetencies that was expected to be achieved to graduate to higher grades. \\nSince, two years’ time has been elapsed without learning due to the pandemic, \\nstudents are required to achieve quite a lot to be able to manage the course in \\nthe grades they are currently enrolled.  \\n3. Going beyond recovery, the education system must be strengthened to facilitate \\naccelerated learning so that learning gains exceeds the learning loss so as to \\nmeet our quality norms and standards. \\n4. Learning recovery and accelerated learning are not a short-term solution. A \\nthorough assessment of learning status and learning objective is necessary to \\nplan ahead. This will also require reform in policies, curricular objectives and \\nthe pedagogy.\\n5. Diverse language background of learners has consistently posed a challenge in \\nmanaging language of instruction in schools and in achieving a balanced and \\nequitable learning among all learners. \\n6. Teacher preparation and building local capacity is the vital component of this \\nrecovery and accelerated learning plan. However, the structure and functions \\nof institutions that existed earlier, such as the Education Training Centers (ETCs), \\nResource Centers (RCs), Resource Persons (RPs) and School Supervisors (SS), \\nhave been abolished. These structures were primarily providing a range of need-\\nbased capacity building in schools and communities. Therefore, until the new \\nsystem and structure with clearly delineated functions are in place, alternative \\nways and means to continuing capacity building in schools and communities is \\nneeded. \\n7. Accelerated learning will require students learning levels to be reached at par. \\nFor this, we must compromise on swapping/merging grades, trimming academic \\ncourse load, or repeating certain courses from lower grades. What is clear to \\nus is that ‘business as usual’ will not help recover the learning loss. We need \\nextra time, extra effort and a new approach to recover and to bring students \\nlearning levels at par. Only when, student’s learning levels is reached at par, we \\ncan rollout accelerated learning. \\n8\\nRecovery and Accelerated Learning (ReAL) Plan (2023-2028) | 8. As the levels of learning loss are different in different grades and levels and is also \\ndifferent in different subject, there is a need to prioritize the interventions under \\nthe plan. Focusing on Basic Education would help minimize the unprecedented \\nburden.    \\n9. The School Education Sector Plan (2022-31) has been recently initiated in \\nNepal, but will now need to be contextualized into the provincial- and local \\neducation sector plans. At the same time, the learning recovery agenda and the \\ncommitments that Nepal has made during the Transforming Education Summit \\n(TES) and as part of the Strategic Partnership Agreement (SPA) of the Global \\nPartnership for Education (GPE) have to be accommodated. The transformational \\ninitiatives will inevitably require adjustments in our existing curricula and the \\npedagogy. In this regard, it would be timely to form a curricula and pedagogy \\nreform committee to address both current and upcoming requirements for \\neducational reform.\\n10. The recovery plan and accelerated learning will require significant additional \\nresources in a time when both domestic- and development assistance \\nbudgets are under pressure. While a number of the proposed strategies can \\nbe accommodated under the SESP , additional financing will be required in a \\nnumber of areas to roll out activities. \\nOpportunities\\nWhile there are a number of challenges that are crucial to be addressed timely and \\nwith appropriate measures, there have been a few lessons learned and best practices \\nalready tested during COVID-19 which provides opportunity to build and scale-up. \\n1. With the SESP initiated, there is a concerted effort among the Government and \\ndevelopment partners to support local governments in the contextualization of \\nthis plan in their local plans and budgets, which offers a way for a systematic \\ninclusion of learning recovery elements.\\n2. Use of ICT, digital platforms, on-line systems and applications have improved \\nsubstantially in the aftermath of COVID-19. Although, this is concentrated mostly \\nin urban areas, these practices can be extended gradually in rural and remote \\nareas with appropriate infrastructure and backstop support. \\n3. Government accelerated its ICT programs in schools by providing additional \\nfunds and for equipment and software as needed in as many schools as possible \\nwithing its budget. Applications and digital platforms are already in operation \\nwhere both students and teachers can join and interact. Along with the \\ngovernment, private sector has also made huge investment in developing digital \\nmeans and platforms for online teaching and learning. Teachers have received \\ntrained to use ICT effectively in continuing teaching and learning activities.\\n9\\nRecovery and Accelerated Learning (ReAL) Plan (2023-2028) | '}, {'topic': 'The Road Map for Recovery and Accelerated Learning', 'content': \"4.

This plan draws on \\nresearch and experience gained during the pandemic to scale successful interventions \\nthat identify and address learning loss, and furthermore, to institutionalize new \\npractices that have been proven to accelerate learning. The framework of the ReAL \\nPlan essentially follows the RAPID Framework9 to address the learning loss and to \\naccelerate the level of learning in schools. The five policy actions recommended in the \\nRAPID Framework has been contextualized and translated into actionable strategies \\nby aligning them with the existing policies, plans and the governance system of the \\ncountry. These policy actions are:\\n1. Reach every child and retain them in school\\n2. Assess learning levels regularly\\n3. Prioritize teaching the fundamentals\\n4. Increase catch-up learning\\n5. Develop psychosocial health and wellbeing\\nThe plan has two phases: In the first two years of the SESP program, the ReAL plan \\nwill roll out interventions to improve basic literacy and numeracy using Teach at the \\nRight Level (TaRL)10 approach that assesses students’ needs and provide targeted \\nsupport. These interventions will be around six to ten weeks11 in duration which will \\nbe determined by the local government depending on school and student’s learning \\nlevel and the need for recovery support. \\nThe second phase of ReAL plan will identify school and classroom practices that are \\nproven to be highly effective and will ensure their institutionalization across the \\neducation system. This scaling up of best practices will assist education providers \\nwith contextually appropriate and sustainable strategies to accelerate learning and \\nimprove system wide learning outcomes.\\nConsidering the possibility of students dropping out of school, due to being absent \\nfrom school for a long time and lagging behind in learning, the plan will make special \\narrangements for identifying such students and bringing them back to school and/or \\nsupporting them for continuing their education through formal or non-formal means . \\n9  World Bank, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, FCDO, UNESCO, UNICEF, and USAID. 2022.

To recover the loss of learning caused by the COVID-19 pandemic \\n2. To institutionalize best practices for recovery and accelerated learning in schools.\\nStrategies\\n1. Comprehensive assessment of student’s learning level and \\nsystem’s capacity. \\n During the past two years, various rapid surveys and analyses have been conducted \\nby the government, development agencies and I/NGOs to trace the impact of COVID \\non education, which to various amounts capture pre- and post-COVID-19 learning \\noutcome data. These studies and reports provide enriching information in assessing \\nthe loss and in setting the context for Nepal. As part of the joint efforts on moving \\nfrom the COVID-19 response to recovery, it was agreed to undertake a learning loss \\nanalysis for informing the learning loss recovery and accelerated learning initiatives. \\nThe learning loss analysis informs the classification of LGs based on the prevalence- \\nand severity of expected learning loss, based on which different need-based support \\npackages that include intensive curriculum and accelerated learning campaigns \\nplanned under the ReAL Plan during then start of the academic years of 2023-24 and \\n2024-25.\\nIt is therefore necessary that children are assessed in terms of their learning \\ncompetencies to set benchmarks for both learning recovery and accelerated learning \\nof students at different levels of learning.\\nMoreover, it is also necessary to keep a comprehensive account on availability and \\nquality of infrastructure, teaching and learning facility in schools, and the quality and \\navailability of schoolteachers.  To keep these accounts readily available for determining \\nright level of teaching, this comprehensive assessment remains as critical-pathway for \\nthe recovery and accelerated learning.\\nActivities \\n1.1 Undertake comprehensive analysis of learning loss based on secondary system \\ndata to identify prevalence and severity of learning loss among different groups \\nof learners\\n1.2 Development of diagnostic tools for rapid diagnostic and regular assessment of \\nstudent’s learning level. \\n12\\nRecovery and Accelerated Learning (ReAL) Plan (2023-2028) | 1.3 Assessment of system capacity – school infrastructure and teaching and learning \\nenvironment, teacher strength and capacity, community and home support \\nsystem.\\n1.4 Improving and strengthening IEMIS database to include school, student and \\nteacher information to support design and delivery of recovery and accelerated \\nlearning program.\\n1.5 Support school and teachers to conduct rapid assessment of student learning \\nstatus using the diagnostic tools. \\nOutcome  \\n1.1 Percent of students with learning level in each LG is determined for planning \\nrecovery activities. \\n1.2 Student groups are identified as “Below Basic Learner (BBL)”, “Basic Learner (BL)”, \\n“Below Average Learner (BAL)”, Proficient Learner (PL), and Advance Learner (AL) \\nin each grade.  \\n1.3 Schools are able to use the diagnostic tools for regular assessment of student’s \\nlearning status.\\n1.4 Schools received appropriate support to improve their capacity. \\n1.5 Teachers are recognized and received capacity building for recovery and accelerated \\nlearning purpose. \\n2. Redefining measurable “learning skills” and the pedagogy\\nLearning skills are commonly referred to as 4C’s: critical thinking, creative thinking, \\ncommunicating, and collaborating. These can be expanded to include more domains \\nof learning that are relevant to our context. Literature provides enriching and wide \\nrange of scope for transforming education pedagogy to meet country specific needs \\nas well as meeting the 21st century skills.  \\nThe concept of educating the whole child in early grades has long been in practice. The \\nwhole child approach builds social and emotional skills at relatively early ages that are \\ncrucial in situations like pandemic and other forms of school closure. The whole school \\napproach focuses on Social, Emotional, Physical, Cognitive and Creative skills12 among \\nother things. A whole child approach, which ensures that each student is healthy, \\nsafe, engaged, supported, and challenged, sets the standard for comprehensive, \\nsustainable school improvement and provides for long-term student success13. Social \\nand emotional skills are in particular relevant to our context where we regularly face \\nnatural and human induced disasters that cause sudden trauma and panic among \\nyoung minds. These skills are seen to build resilience and social responsibility. \\n12  Fisher, D., & Frey, N. (2019).

Pre-Primary / ECD/PPC (5–6-year age) – One year pre-school concept with \\nreadiness for graded learning. Basic orientation and recognition of alpha/\\nnumeric image, its sound and relationships, recognition of images of natural \\nworld –flora and fauna, and basic health and hygiene including recognition of \\nsocial and cultural relations. \\n2. Early Basic Level – Grades 1-3 (6–9-year age) – Along with Foundational Literacy \\nand Numeracy (FLN), basic Social and Emotional skills, health and hygiene \\npractices, and introductory ICT. \\n15  Chakera, S., Haffner, D., Harrop, E., (2020) UNICEF Eastern and Southern Africa Region Working Paper – Structured \\nPedagogy: For Real-Time Equitable Improvements in Learning Outcomes.

Accelerating Learning Recovery: A Guidance Note for Addressing Learning Losses in the Context of \\nCOVID-19 and Building Back Better. \\n15\\nRecovery and Accelerated Learning (ReAL) Plan (2023-2028) | 3. Lower-Basic Level – Grades 4-5 (9–11-year age) – basic mastery in reding, \\nnumeracy, and social and emotional skills, survival/life skills, ICT and subject \\nspecific knowledge.  \\n4. Upper Basic Level – 6-8 (11–14-year age) – advanced level skills in ICT, \\nintroduction of technical and vocational skills, and specific subjects such as \\nScience, geography, culture, history, etc.  \\n2. Focused and refined instruction17:\\n1. Targeted instruction : Providing instruction that is appropriate to the learning \\nlevels of each child, usually by using assessments to group students by level of \\nproficiency rather than by age or grade, for a dedicated hour or period\\n2. Small group tutoring : complements classroom instruction by offering \\npersonalized teaching and guidance to small groups of students\\n3. Self-guided learning : Allows students to progress, incrementally and at their \\nown pace, toward mastery of foundational skills with minimal support from \\nteachers; can serve as complement to regular instruction and can leverage \\n(digital) technology when conditions are appropriate. \\n4. Individualized learning :  teacher should be able to use diagnostic tools \\nindividually for determining targeted intervention for individuals and small \\ngroups. \\nOutcome\\n1. Learning objectives and instructional designs are aligned with students’ \\nage and grade that allows at least two years’ time for the student and their \\nteachers to achieve. \\n2. Learning outcomes are measurable and clearly defined for each grade.\\n3. Teachers are trained to switch and adopt appropriate pedagogy as needed. \\n3. Strategy for Learning Recovery\\nLearning loss has been a recurrent phenomenon that is caused by ad-hoc events \\nsuch as COVID-19 pandemic, and natural and human induced disasters. Moreover, \\nthere are also recurrent learning loss caused by the system itself. Such as, students \\nnot meeting minimum learning benchmarks is the loss of learning. The percent of \\nstudent not meeting the minimum benchmarks are huge and is a regularly occurring \\nphenomena. Therefore, it is suggested to include ways in the curricula and pedagogy \\nso as to provide regular remedial support for students to lagging behind in key learning \\ndomains.        \\nWhat we have learned so far is that, “business as usual” model will not help recover \\nthe gap and in reaching the trajectory that will lead us to an accelerated learning. \\nSeveral action steps are hence necessary to gain the basic competency so as to trigger \\nthe accelerated learning.\\n17  Ibid.\\n16\\nRecovery and Accelerated Learning (ReAL) Plan (2023-2028) | Activities\\n1. Intensive but flexible program – Local Government and schools will be able \\nto select package that is for learners based on their learning recovery needs. \\nLocal governments and schools will determine learning recovery needs based \\non assessment of students that they will carry-out using diagnostic tools. \\n2. Consolidated and focused curricula for Recovery of Learning Loss  – focused \\ncurricula will be designed to achieve basic skills and competencies required for \\nstudents to be in a specific grade or level. First two years of the plan will focus \\nin achieving the competencies determined in the recovery curricula. \\n3. Remedial support with extended learning time  (with option for multiple \\ninterventions) – in some cases there may be need for extend teaching and \\nlearning hours, but in majority cases it is possible by squeezing a few hours out \\nof the education hours and to offer remedial support.  \\n4. Expansion and recognition of non-school based teaching and learning  It \\nhas increasingly become a necessity to diversify the scope and recognition of \\neducation beyond school. Hence, the education system must be made flexible \\nand open to incorporate various forms of education both as part and whole of \\nlearning. Some of the sub-action points are following to open-up our education \\nsystem:\\n \\na. Remote learning  and homebased support  have increasingly become a \\nnecessary condition for both recovery and accelerated learning. Hence, \\nboth strategies must be fully optimized and made available to the large \\ngroup of learners and especially for those who   preparing parents, \\nguardians and children everyone to play teacher’s role as mandatory.\\nb. Expansion of Outreach Centers and Outreach Programs  targeting \\nvulnerable and at-risk children, including learning deprived children and \\nout of school children.\\nc. Empowering local bodies to run community learning centers  to catch up \\non learning loss due to sudden school closure for whatever reason\\nd. Recognition and promotion of learning beyond schools,  not only for \\nthose who are unable to attend school but all those who find it safe and \\ncomfortable to attend those centers than the school.    \\ne. Self-directed learning,  such as peer to peer learning, learning at community \\ncenters, using internet and open and interactive learning, etc.\\n5. Learning Recovery Campaign  – to inform and encourage participation of \\nparents, community and other stakeholders by mobilizing media, social \\nnetwork, governments and political bodies, and the civil society. \\n17\\nRecovery and Accelerated Learning (ReAL) Plan (2023-2028) | 6. Strengthening and enhancing learning portals  already existing such as Sikai \\nChautari  for learning recovery, expanding this into a Learning Management \\nSystem (LMS) that include options for peer support and exchange of problems \\nand good practices among local governments and teachers with regard to \\nlearning recovery.\\n7. Learning recovery is included in SIP and LGs include it in the MEP .\\n8. Model schools will be required to develop and follow contextual strategies to \\nadopt and also support other schools to implement.\\n9. SMC/PTA will include learning recovery as priority agenda in their regular \\nmeetings.    \\n10. Teacher preparation for remedial support \\na.

Preparing parents, guardians and children  to perform teacher’s role as \\nmandatory condition. \\n12. Encouraging Local government and Civil Society to mobilize volunteers for \\ncoaching, mentoring and supervision and learning in tole reading groups. \\n13. Frequent assessment of student’s learning . Refining various tools and \\nprocesses of student assessment including EGRA/EGMA, CBEGRA, NASA, \\nNARN, and other regular tools used by schools. \\n14. Strengthening and updating IEMIS to increase full- and timely reporting \\nand the use of EMIS data in monitoring, planning and budgeting of learning \\nrecovery activities.\\n15. Support schemes for families living in extreme poverty and with school going \\nage children. \\n18\\nRecovery and Accelerated Learning (ReAL) Plan (2023-2028) | 4. Strategies for Accelerated Learning\\n1. Policy Reform\\na. Teacher development policy  including provision of structure and functional \\nmandate to existing institutions such as PETCs, and EDCUs.\\nb. Policy on pedagogical practices  including institutionalization of remedial \\nand extended learning support system to students lagging behind. \\nConsolidated curricula, revised learning objectives and benchmarks, \\nlearning standards, and recognition of different forms of learning – remote \\nand home-based, self-directed learning, etc.\\nc. Policy on the use of volunteers and civil society  in conducting short-term \\nand intensive teacher training programs, and in conducting teaching, \\nmentoring, and coaching services in select school and communities.\\nd. Mandatory policy on community learning centers  to be run and managed \\nby the local government. \\ne. Mandatory policy on Family Registration  in nearby community school as \\nschool of their community.  This will help ensure free enrollment and free \\neducation and to offer a wide range of benefits to those families. In return, \\nthe family must provide some support to school. \\n5. Implementation Strategies\\nAs discussed earlier, the plan will be implemented in two phases with its first phase \\nfocusing more on recovery and achieving basic competencies and skills that each \\nstudent must acquire to be in a specific grade or level of education. Similarly, because \\nof diverse learning needs and due to challenges in reaching out every single school-\\nage child in the country, one blanket approach would not be appropriate for all. Hence \\na multipronged approach would be adopted as the local context may demand. \\nSince we must regain the loss of learning at the earliest possible and before learning \\nloss becomes permanent and irrecoverable, a concerted efforts and productive \\nengagement of all stakeholders including government and non-government agencies, \\nprivate sector, media, organized professional and occupational groups, and the \\ncommunity and parents is a must. Hence, the plan has recommended for running an \\nintensive campaign for the recovery of learning loss.    \\nPhased and Prioritized Implementation for Learning Recovery  \\nThe plan will roll out interventions to improve basic literacy and numeracy using a \\nTeach at the Right Level (TaRL) approach that assesses students’ needs and provides \\ntargeted support. These interventions will be around six to ten weeks in duration and \\n19\\nRecovery and Accelerated Learning (ReAL) Plan (2023-2028) | will focus on rapid recovery of basic skills and competencies among students. The \\nexact duration of intervention will be determined by respective Local Government \\nbased on student’s level of learning. The second phase of ReAL will identify school \\nand classroom practices that are proven to be highly effective and ensure their \\ninstitutionalization across the education system. This scaling up of best practices will \\nassist education providers with contextually appropriate and sustainable strategies to \\naccelerate learning and improve system wide learning outcomes.\\n \\n5359 3193 5045 3667 4436 2924 351121122\\n1280620851\\n1415717585\\n110491412135114\\n2021239613\\n2574232234\\n1421021686\\nPROVINCE 1 MADHE SH BAGMATI GANDAKI LUMBINI KARNAL I SUDUR  P.Number of Sc hool, Students, and Teachers in Grades 3-8 b y Province\\nSchool with grades  3-8\\n Teachers at B asic Level\\n Students in grades  3-8\\nSource Flash Report I, 2077 (2020-21). CEHRD\\nFirst Phase: Recovery of learning loss phase\\nThe first phase of the plan will run for two years from mid-April 2023 through March \\n2025. In these two years, the plan will primarily focus in regaining loss of learning in \\nall schools across the country. While, all community schools throughout the country \\nwill receive earmarked grant for learning recovery, intensive recovery program will \\nbe launched in schools in selected 50 LGs with priority to those with lowest learning \\nlevel as determined based on comprehensive assessment. Second year will continue \\nto expand coverage of intensive recovery activities in 250 LGs. \\nThe Standard Operating Procedures and Guidelines (SOPG) prepared specifically for \\nthe implementation of recovery activities, provides flexibility for the implementation \\nintensive recovery activities by interested LGs and I/NGOs to work in additional LGs \\nwith their own resources.     \\nA national campaign for the recovery of learning loss will be organized widely across \\nthe country using media and other social platforms for to welcome both government, \\nprivate sector and I/NGOs to expand implementation of intensive recovery activities \\nin schools and communities.\\n20\\nRecovery and Accelerated Learning (ReAL) Plan (2023-2028) | First-year Activities\\n1. Undertaking of comprehensive analysis of learning loss, including mapping of \\nsecondary data sources and assessments, institutional capacity building and \\ndevelopment of tools that local governments can use to unpack their data to \\nidentify levels of learning loss and disparities within this.\\n2. An intensive but flexible intervention in prioritized LG and schools to recover \\nthe learning gap among students lagging behind in foundational literacy and \\nnumeracy including social and emotional skills.  LGs and schools will be able to \\nselect appropriate package of intervention that will range from a few weeks to 10 \\nweeks based on assessment of student’s learning level. Using the diagnostic tools \\nand the operational guidelines provided by CEHRD (Annex A), local government \\nand school will determine student’s learning level.  \\ni. For in-school children:  CEHRD will mobilize school and teacher led campaign \\nto reach all school-going children currently attending school. \\nii. For out-of-school children:  CEHRD will call all development partners, LEG, \\ncivil society and the local governments to participate and contribute to this \\nmission in reaching all school-going age children who are currently out-of-\\nschool including children with disability, marginalized and deprived, and with \\ndifferent sexual orientation. \\n3. National Campaign. CEHRD in collaboration and partnership with all three levels \\nof government, private sector and interest groups, civil society and professional \\norganizations, and national and international non-government organizations \\nwill run a two day long national campaign for the recovery of learning loss \\nthrough out the country. Different forms of media and social platforms will be \\nutilized to propagate the message for effective participation and support for its \\nimplementation. \\n4. ERO will carry-out series of research, development and testing works: \\ni. Conduct a broad-brush type research using mostly secondary sources of \\ninformation with limited primary research to quantify the loss  in school \\neducation due to COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal. \\nii. Develop and administer diagnostic tools  (Annex B) to assess students’ learning \\nlevel in each grade and in key subjects – especially in grades 3-8. Grade 3 is a \\ntransition grade for acquiring certainly level of mastery in foundational skills \\nand then moving into advanced levels of learning in grade 4 and onwards. \\niii. Develop appropriate software and online system to assess students’ \\nperformance results. Based on the test results, students can be grouped as \\nbelow basic learner, basic learner, proficient learner and advance learner \\nwhich has been already in use by CEHRD. \\n5. CDC capacity will be developed for the following task for overall reform for \\nminimizing systemic loss plus accelerated learning:  \\n21\\nRecovery and Accelerated Learning (ReAL) Plan (2023-2028) | i. Com prehensive and comparative research on Nepal’s school curricula against \\nregional and international best practices and its compatibility with emerging \\ntrends in pedagogical practices in the regional and internationally. \\nii. A thorough review and assessment of vertical and horizontal coherence of the \\nschool curricula \\niii. Equipping CDC with high-tech communication lab to host regular interaction \\nprograms with provincial and local bodies, schools, school teachers, and \\neducators on subjects related curricular objectives, teaching and learning \\nmaterials, and pedagogy and instructional designs.   \\n6. Development of Teaching Resource Materials (TRM)  for Learning Recovery \\nthat will include diagnostic tool, adjusted content, and individual/small group \\nlearning enhancement plan. The technical team will develop the TRM (Annex C) in \\ncoordination with CEHRD, CDC, ERO and NEB.  The Technical Team will also develop \\nTRM for Accelerated Learning at some later stage.\\n7. Partnership with Teacher Professional Organizations  to run the remedial program.  \\ni. CEHRD will work closely with the teacher professional organizations for \\n1. Preparing teachers for both remedial campaign  and also for running the \\nrefresher courses for accelerated learning  that will follow from the next \\nschool year.\\n2. Incentivizing teachers for additional work load for the remedial campaign and \\nfor the accelerated learning.\\n3. Working out the modality for teacher capacity building, use of diagnostic tools \\nand to administer need based remedial and refresher program. \\n8.  Partnership with Provincial and Local Governments  to run the recovery program.  \\ni. CEHRD will sign MOU with local governments to mobilize both school teachers, \\nvolunteers, and the locally based civil society organizations to support the \\nrecovery campaign for students in both schools and out-of-school.\\nii. CEHRD and the local governments will work-out the modality of incentives \\nfor schools, teachers and volunteers including technical support and the cost-\\nsharing schemes between the local government and CEHRD.\\niii. A joint monitoring team will be formed to periodically monitor and supervise \\nthe campaign in their respective jurisdictions.\\n9. CEHRD will jointly develop and share operational guidelines  with implementation \\nplan  of the recovery to be launched at the start of the school year.  \\ni. Continuation and effective implementation of integrated curriculum  in Grades \\n1-3.  \\n22\\nRecovery and Accelerated Learning (ReAL) Plan (2023-2028) |  Although, grades 1-3 is not part of the intensive recovery intervention under the \\nReAL Plan, it is necessary that these founding grades of basic education continues \\nto receive priority intervention. Under the SESP , integrated curriculum will be \\nimplemented effectively to meet the learning needs of these early grade children.      \\n1. Effective implementation of Early Grade Learning Programs for grades 1-3\\n2. Supply of teacher guides and additional learning materials for children.\\n3. Regular assessment of students’ progress through one assessment tool (CAS/\\nCBEGRA like tool)\\nii. Remedial/Refresher program  in the classroom for Grades 3-8\\n1. Set the basic learning competency/benchmarks to be achieve during the \\nrecovery plan.  \\n2. Regularly assess students using the diagnostic tool (ERO to design the tool)\\n3. Set aside adequate time in the beginning of the school calendar (at least 3 \\nhours each day) for conducting remedial classes for students lagging behind. \\n4. Divide children into groups and teach to their level/ needs \\niii. Student Assessments  periodically to monitor progress and to adjust teaching \\nand learning inputs. Even after completion of the recovery plan activities, \\nteachers will continue to practice student assessment throughout the session. \\nContents of the assessment needs will be inbuilt in the existing CAS.\\nPhase I – Second-year Activities\\n1. Continuation of Intensive campaign  and other activities or year one in the \\nremaining schools throughout the country. \\nSecond Phase: Accelerated learning phase\\nThe second phase will run for three years beginning from April 2025 through March \\n2028. In these three years, the plan will focus in institutionalizing best practices for \\nimproving learning level by including remedial and extra coaching and mentoring \\nas part of the pedagogy. This will help improve learning loss caused by both ad-hoc \\nand system induced recurrent loss.  These programs will be imbedded in the current \\nSESP to prioritize learning objectives and skills that not only meet the needs of the \\ncountry but is also in sync with the global trends and directions such as Transforming \\nEducation initiative. \\n23\\nRecovery and Accelerated Learning (ReAL) Plan (2023-2028) | Activities\\na. After the intensive campaign in the first phase, CEHRD in collaboration with CDC \\nand ERO will introduce a mandatory refresher course,  based on assessment/\\nCAS results, included in the regular curricula and the pedagogy to be taught at \\nthe beginning of school year \\ni. The refresher course will address the recurrent learning loss caused by \\nsystemic issues including any additional loss caused by ad-hoc phenomena. \\nii. The refresher course will be basically designed to refresh and reinforce \\nstudents’ learning so that they are ready and stepped-up for taking the \\nnew and advanced level curricula that will be taught in their current grade. \\nThis refresher course will be administered at the beginning of the grade \\nlevel education.\\niii. These refresher courses will be designed to cover between 10-20 percent \\nof the curricula that was taught in the lower grade. Schools will select the \\nappropriate level of refresher based on student’s learning status. Five levels \\nof refresher courses will be designed to address students with different \\nlearning level. Students at Below Basic Learner will receive approximately \\n30% of the curricula as refresher, students at “ Basic Learner (BL) ” level \\nwill receive approximately 25% of refresher, students at “Above Average \\nLearner (AAL)  level will receive 20% of refresher course, Proficient Learner \\n(PL) level students will receive 15% and the Advance Learner (AL)  will \\nreceive only 10% of the refresher course.   \\nb. CEHRD in collaboration with ERO will introduce diagnostic tool18 designed \\nfor assessing performance level of students in each grade. These diagnostic \\ntools will be developed based on curricular objectives and minimum learning \\nbenchmarks specified in the curriculum.  Schools will use these diagnostic tools \\nat the beginning of school year. Students will be placed for appropriate level of \\nrefresher course.    \\ni. With the support from ERO, schools will use rapid assessment tools to \\nassess students’ performance level during and at the end of the refresher \\ncourse. All these results will be stored in the EMIS so that the progress \\nrecords can be traced for regular study and to update the policy and \\nstrategies of refresher programs.   \\nii. The diagnostic tools will be simple, mostly structured and fully computerized \\nso that school teachers will not be required to score or evaluate students \\nwork. A simple software will allow teachers to input in the data in any \\ndevices connected to internet such as mobile phone, iPad, laptop/desktop \\netc. Once the results are entered it will auto generate the list of students \\nwith their grouping as above average, average, and below average.  \\n18  Note: The diagnostic tools used during the remedial campaign will be readjusted to meet the curricular outcomes \\nexpected in each grade and subject.  \\n24\\nRecovery and Accelerated Learning (ReAL) Plan (2023-2028) | c.

Systemic loss of learning caused by inadequate \\neducational infrastructure is even higher that demand greater attention on recovery \\nactivities in schools to meet the minimum learning benchmarks. In the backdrop of \\nfederal constitutional mandate, financing all these activities are neither feasible nor \\nit is sustainable to be funded alone by the federal government alone. Hence, the \\nfollowing cost sharing scheme is suggested:  \\n1. Regular Program in All 753 LG.  The Project Implementation Plan of CEHRD \\nhas made specific provision for implementing activities in schools for the \\nrecovery of learning loss caused by COVID-19 and other disaster. The PIM has \\nallocated a lumpsum grant of NPR 600,000; 500,000; and 400,000 for each \\nMetropolitan, Urban LG, and Rural LG respectively for this task. This comes to \\nbe around US$2.6 million per annum. This grant will be continued in all 753 \\nLG during the ReAL Plan period. The PIM has already specified the type of \\nactivities, such as Additional Classes, Remedial Learning, and Tutorial Classes \\ncan be implemented using this grant. The SOPG (annex A) provides further \\nclarification and operational guidelines for using this grant in schools.\\n2. Intensive Program in 250 LG . Besides the regular program discussed above, \\nMOEST and the Joint Financing Partners have agreed to implement more \\nfocused and intensive program and activities in 250 LGs (50 LGs in the first \\nyear, and 250 LGs in the second year). The cost of the intensive program will \\nbe additional to the ongoing learning recovery grant. The program will include \\nintensive recovery based on student’s learning level. Teams of experts from \\nCEHRD, CDC and ERO have already developed the SOPG, TRM and training \\npackages, and the Diagnostic tools for this purpose (see annex A, B and C). \\n3. Partnership with Provincial and Local Governments.  MOEST has already \\ncarried out consultation meetings with the representative of the federations of \\nurban municipality and rural LG. The SOPG provides the option for LG’s who are \\nnot in the list of 250 LGs with intensive program but are capable and willing to \\nrun the intensive program will be also entitled to receive the program materials \\nand some technical inputs.  \\n4. Partnership with I/NGOs  – Several I/NGOs have already implemented recovery \\nactivities in schools in their respective program areas. CEHRD has taken the \\nlead in mapping and working with the I/NGOs to come-up with their interest \\nto implement the ReAL plan in LGs of their presence. I/NGOs presence with \\nrecovery activities is estimated to be in about 15% of LGs. \\n28\\nRecovery and Accelerated Learning (ReAL) Plan (2023-2028) | \"}]\n"
